# Data-Analysis-Project

### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis 
### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sales and customer data to derive key insights that can drive business strategies. 
I applied Excel functions to: 
Calculate total and average sales by product category and region.
Identify trends in sales transactions across different regions.
Highlight the highest-selling products and top customers.
Assess revenue contributions by region and recognize products with no sales in recent periods.
I also wrote SQL queries to analyze sales data focusing on various aspects of sales performance which will help to inform business decisions through data analysis.

### Data Sources
The primary sources of Data used is Capstone Project.xlxs containing sales data which includes information on sales transactions, such as product categories, transaction amounts, dates, and regions as well as Customer data which encompasses details about customers, including demographics, purchase history, and preferences.
