This project aims to analyze sales and customer data to derive key insights that can drive business strategies. 
I applied Excel functions to: 
Calculate total and average sales by product category and region.
Identify trends in sales transactions across different regions.
Highlight the highest-selling products and top customers.
Assess revenue contributions by region and recognize products with no sales in recent periods.
I also wrote SQL queries to analyze sales data focusing on various aspects of sales performance which will help to inform business decisions through data analysis.
